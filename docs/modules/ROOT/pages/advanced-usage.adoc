:keywords: mapping-suite, sdk, python, advanced, tutorial

== Working with Package Components

=== Loading from Archives

The SDK supports loading mapping packages from ZIP archives:

[source,python]
----
from mssdk.services.load_mapping_package import load_mapping_package_from_archive

# Load from a ZIP archive
archive_path = Path("path/to/package.zip")
mapping_package = load_mapping_package_from_archive(archive_path)
----

=== Custom Loading Strategies

You can implement custom loading behavior:

[source,python]
----
from mssdk.adapters.loader import MappingPackageAssetLoader

class CustomLoader(MappingPackageAssetLoader):
    def load(self, path: Path):
        # Custom loading logic here
        pass

# Use custom loader
mapping_package = load_mapping_package_from_folder(
    path,
    mapping_package_loader=CustomLoader()
)
----

== Validation and Testing

=== Using Test Suites

The SDK includes support for various types of testing:

* SPARQL-based testing
* SHACL validation
* Test data transformation

=== Working with Test Data

[source,python]
----
# Access test suites
for test_suite in mapping_package.test_data_suites:
    print(f"Test suite: {test_suite.title}")

# Access SPARQL tests
for sparql_suite in mapping_package.test_suites_sparql:
    print(f"SPARQL suite: {sparql_suite.title}")
----

== Best Practices

=== Package Organization

1. Keep related mappings together
2. Use meaningful names for mapping files
3. Document your mappings in conceptual mapping files
4. Include comprehensive test data

=== Error Handling

Always implement proper error handling:

[source,python]
----
try:
    mapping_package = load_mapping_package_from_folder(path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Mapping package folder not found")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid package structure: {e}")
----

== Advanced Features

=== Working with Metadata Constraints

[source,python]
----
# Access package constraints
constraints = mapping_package.metadata.eligibility_constraints
print(f"Package constraints: {constraints}")
----

=== Package Integrity

The SDK includes features for verifying package integrity:

[source,python]
----
# Check package signature
signature = mapping_package.metadata.signature
print(f"Package signature: {signature}")
----

== Tips and Tricks

* Use the package index for efficient content access
* Implement custom loaders for special use cases
* Leverage the built-in validation features
* Keep your mapping packages organized and well-documented
