== Introduction

The Mapping Suite SDK is a powerful tool designed for working with mapping suites, particularly focusing on the re-use of mapping suites in transformation pipelines. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for handling mapping packages.

== Key Concepts

=== Mapping Package
A mapping package is a collection of related mapping components that include:

* Metadata - Package identification and versioning information
* Conceptual Mappings - Spreadsheets defining mapping concepts (Excel/XLSX)
* Technical Mappings - Files containing transformation rules (RML/RDF)
* Vocabulary Mappings - Controlled vocabulary resource files that can be referenced by the rules (JSON, CSV)
* Test Suites - Various test data (XML)
* Validation Suites - Various validation rules (SHACL, SPARQL)

=== Package Structure
A typical mapping package follows this structure:

[source]
----
mapping-package/
├── metadata.json
├── transformation/
│   ├── conceptual_mappings.xlsx
│   ├── mappings/
│   └── resources/
├── test_data/
└── validation/
    ├── shacl/
    └── sparql/
----

== Getting Started

// === Installation
//
// [source,bash]
// ----
// pip install mapping-suite-sdk
// ----

=== Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of loading a mapping package:

[source,python]
----
from pathlib import Path
from mssdk.services.load_mapping_package import load_mapping_package_from_folder

# Load from a folder
package_path = Path("path/to/mapping/package")
mapping_package = load_mapping_package_from_folder(package_path)

# Access package components
print(mapping_package.metadata.title)
print(mapping_package.metadata.mapping_version)
----
