= Extractors in Mapping Suite SDK
:description: Advanced usage and customization of package extractors
:keywords: mapping-suite-sdk, extractors, github, archive, custom extractors

== Overview

The Mapping Suite SDK provides two primary extractors for handling mapping packages:

- `ArchivePackageExtractor`: For working with ZIP archives
- `GithubPackageExtractor`: For extracting packages from GitHub repositories

== Archive Package Extractor

=== Basic Usage

[source,python]
----
from pathlib import Path
from mapping_suite_sdk import ArchivePackageExtractor

# Create an extractor instance
extractor = ArchivePackageExtractor()

# Extract to a specific destination
output_path = extractor.extract(
    source_path=Path("package.zip"),
    destination_path=Path("output_directory")
)

# Extract to a temporary location (automatically cleaned up)
with extractor.extract_temporary(Path("package.zip")) as temp_path:
    # Work with extracted files
    print(f"Extracted to temporary path: {temp_path}")
    # Files will be automatically cleaned up after the block
----

=== Advanced Packing

[source,python]
----
# Pack a directory into a ZIP file
source_dir = Path("folder_to_archive")
output_path = Path("output/my_package")

# Creates a ZIP without including the root directory
zip_path = extractor.pack_directory(source_dir, output_path)
print(f"Created ZIP at: {zip_path}")
----

== GitHub Package Extractor

=== Basic Repository Extraction

[source,python]
----
from mapping_suite_sdk import GithubPackageExtractor

extractor = GithubPackageExtractor()

# Extract a specific package from a repository
package_path = extractor.extract(
    repository_url="https://github.com/org/repo",
    destination_path=Path("/local/path"),
    package_path=Path("mappings/package_v1"),
    branch_or_tag_name="main"
)
----

=== Multiple Package Extraction

[source,python]
----
# Extract multiple packages matching a pattern
with extractor.extract_temporary(
    repository_url="https://github.com/org/repo",
    packages_path_pattern="mappings/package*",
    branch_or_tag_name="v1.0.0"
) as package_paths:
    for path in package_paths:
        print(f"Found package at: {path}")
        # Process each package as needed
----

== Custom Extractor Implementation

You can create custom extractors by implementing the `MappingPackageExtractorABC` abstract base class:

[source,python]
----
from pathlib import Path
from contextlib import contextmanager
from typing import Generator, List

from mapping_suite_sdk.adapters.extractor import MappingPackageExtractorABC

class CustomPackageExtractor(MappingPackageExtractorABC):
    def extract(
        self,
        source: Path,
        destination: Path,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Path:

        # Implement custom extraction logic
        destination.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        # Your extraction code here
        return destination

    @contextmanager
    def extract_temporary(
        self,
        source: Path,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Generator[List[Path], None, None]:

        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            temp_path = Path(temp_dir)
            # Your temporary extraction logic
            yield [temp_path]

# Usage example
custom_extractor = CustomPackageExtractor()
with custom_extractor.extract_temporary(Path("source_package")) as paths:
    for path in paths:
        print(f"Extracted to: {path}")
----

== Best Practices

- Always use context managers (`with` statement) for temporary extractions
- Handle exceptions gracefully
- Be mindful of system resources when working with large packages
- Consider network and storage limitations when extracting from remote sources

== Error Handling

[source,python]
----
from pathlib import Path
from mapping_suite_sdk import ArchivePackageExtractor, GithubPackageExtractor

def safe_extract(extractor, source):
    try:
        with extractor.extract_temporary(source):
            # Process extracted paths
            pass
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Source not found: {source}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Extraction error: {e}")

# Example usage
archive_extractor = ArchivePackageExtractor()
github_extractor = GithubPackageExtractor()

safe_extract(archive_extractor, Path("non_existent.zip"))
safe_extract(
    github_extractor,
    "https://github.com/non-existent-repo/mapping-packages"
)
