# Mapping Package

There are different concerns when Mapping suites are being developed than when the mapping suites are being re-used in transformation pipelines.   

Int his initial phase of SDK development we will focus primarily on re-use concerns. Thsi has an effect on the SDK model, and it is tighly connected to the perspective of a ZIP file with a file&folder structure inside. 

# UC1 - Model in the Pipeline - ReuserModel
# UC2 - Model in the MWB Editor - DeveloperModel
