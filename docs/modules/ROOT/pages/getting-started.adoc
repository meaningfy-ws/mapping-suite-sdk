== Introduction

The Mapping Suite SDK is a powerful tool designed for working with mapping suites, particularly focusing on the re-use of mapping suites in transformation pipelines. This SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for handling mapping packages.

== Key Concepts

=== Mapping Package
A mapping package is a collection of related mapping components that include:

* Metadata - Package identification and versioning information
* Conceptual Mappings - Excel spreadsheets defining mapping concepts
* Technical Mappings - RML files containing transformation rules
* Vocabulary Mappings - Resource files (JSON, CSV, XML)
* Test Suites - Various test data and validation rules

=== Package Structure
A typical mapping package follows this structure:

[source]
----
mapping-package/
├── metadata.json
├── transformation/
│   ├── conceptual_mappings.xlsx
│   ├── mappings/
│   └── resources/
├── test_data/
└── validation/
    ├── shacl/
    └── sparql/
----

== Getting Started

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
pip install mssdk
----

=== Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of loading a mapping package:

[source,python]
----
from pathlib import Path
from mssdk.services.load_mapping_package import load_mapping_package_from_folder

# Load from a folder
package_path = Path("path/to/mapping/package")
mapping_package = load_mapping_package_from_folder(package_path)

# Access package components
print(mapping_package.metadata.title)
print(mapping_package.metadata.mapping_version)
----
