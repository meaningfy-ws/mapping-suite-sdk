:keywords: mapping-suite-sdk, XML, RML, mapping, transformation, SDK

== Introduction

The Mapping Suite SDK is a powerful software development kit designed to standardize and simplify the handling of mapping packages containing XML-to-RML (RDF Mapping Language) transformation rules and related components.

== Key Features

=== Flexible Package Management
- Load mapping packages from multiple sources
** Local folders
** ZIP archives
** GitHub repositories
** MongoDB databases

=== Comprehensive Serialization
- Convert mapping packages between file-based and object representations
- Support for complex mapping package structures
- Robust error handling and validation

=== Advanced Extraction
- Flexible extractors for different package sources
- Temporary and permanent extraction modes
- Pattern-based package discovery

=== MongoDB Integration
- Type-safe repository operations
- CRUD functionality for mapping packages
- Advanced querying capabilities

=== Observability
- Built-in OpenTelemetry tracing
- Performance monitoring
- Detailed error tracking

=== In future
* Validation service
* Transformation capabilities

== Quick Start

=== Installation

==== Using pip
[source,bash]
----
pip install mapping-suite-sdk
----

==== Using Poetry
[source,bash]
----
poetry add mapping-suite-sdk
----

=== Basic Usage

[source,python]
----
from pathlib import Path
import mapping_suite_sdk as mssdk

# Load a mapping package
package = mssdk.load_mapping_package_from_folder(
    mapping_package_folder_path=Path("/path/to/mapping/package")
)

# Serialize the package
mssdk.serialise_mapping_package(
    mapping_package=package,
    serialisation_folder_path=Path("/output/path")
)
----

== Core Components

=== Adapters
- *Extractor*: Handle package extraction from various sources
- *Loader*: Load different components of mapping packages
- *Repository*: Manage package storage and retrieval
- *Serialiser*: Convert packages between formats
- *Tracer*: Provide observability and performance monitoring

=== Services
- Package loading from multiple sources
- Package serialization
- Tracing and monitoring

== Supported Mapping Package Components

- Metadata
- Conceptual mappings
- Technical mapping suites
- Vocabulary mapping suites
- Test data suites
- SPARQL validation suites
- SHACL validation suites

== Advanced Features

=== Custom Extraction
[source,python]
----
from mapping_suite_sdk.adapters.extractor import MappingPackageExtractorABC

class CustomPackageExtractor(MappingPackageExtractorABC):
    def extract(self, source, destination, **kwargs):
        # Implement custom extraction logic
        pass

    def extract_temporary(self, source, **kwargs):
        # Implement temporary extraction
        pass
----

=== Tracing and Monitoring
[source,python]
----
import mapping_suite_sdk as mssdk
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter

# Enable tracing
mssdk.set_mssdk_tracing(True)

# Add console exporter for trace details
console_exporter = ConsoleSpanExporter()
mssdk.add_span_processor_to_mssdk_tracer_provider(console_exporter)
----

== Performance and Scalability

- Efficient package handling
- Minimal resource overhead
- Supports large mapping packages
- Configurable tracing and monitoring
