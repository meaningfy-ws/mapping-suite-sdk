# Mapping Package

There are different concerns when mapping suites are being developed than when they are being re-used in
transformation pipelines.

In this initial phase of SDK development we will focus primarily on re-use concerns. This has an effect on the SDK
model, and it is tightly connected to the perspective of an archive (ZIP) file with a specific folder structure inside.

# UC1 - Model in the Pipeline - UserModel

# UC2 - Model in the MWB Editor - DeveloperModel
